During this current situation we have been getting out and doing some more hiking about. Recently we revisited the Venman parklands and also the Brisbane Koala Bushlands....

Anyone else keep to build a list of good hikes in the Redlands area that lets us get outdoors and away from people ðŸ˜‰

Get outside (while you can) and enjoy the fresh air, get some vitamin D, Breath in the fresh air and perform  some forest bathing. If you see someone say hello but lets not give any high-fives on the way by :)

Good options around various length tracks from 30mins to a few hours. This is more well known so there is a few people about.

Simple loop track with no options. Track is a prepared surface that is suitable for strollers and small children.

A bit out of the way and we never spotted another person on this track.

This is that area you pass when you drive to the Gold Coast :) Basically a fire track in a huge loop....would make a good mountain bike ride also.
